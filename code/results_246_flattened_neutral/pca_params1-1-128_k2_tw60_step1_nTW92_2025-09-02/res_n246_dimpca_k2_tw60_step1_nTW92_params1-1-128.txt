Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /tmp/matplotlib-e1y6sm0r because the default path (/a/home/cc/students/csguests/tomraz/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
